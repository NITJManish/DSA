## How to determine if a binary tree is height-balanced?

A height balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the height of the left subtree and right subtree of any node does not differ by more than 1 and both the left and right subtree are also height balanced.

code 

boolean isBalanced(Node node)
    {
        int lh; /* for height of left subtree */
 
        int rh; /* for height of right subtree */
 
        /* If tree is empty then return true */
        if (node == null)
            return true;
 
        /* Get the height of left and right sub trees */
        lh = height(node.left);
        rh = height(node.right);
 
        if (Math.abs(lh - rh) <= 1 && isBalanced(node.left)
            && isBalanced(node.right))
            return true;
 
        /* If we reach here then tree is not height-balanced
         */
        return false;
    }
