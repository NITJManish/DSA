Given an array A[] consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s. The task is to sort the array, i.e., put all 0s first, then all 1s and all 2s in last.

This problem is the same as the famous “Dutch National Flag problem”. The problem was proposed by Edsger Dijkstra. The problem is as follows:



 static void sort012(int a[], int n)
    {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = n - 1;
        int mid = 0, temp = 0;
        // Iterate till all the elements
        // are sorted
        while (mid <= hi) {
            switch (a[mid]) {
                // If the element is 0
                case 0: {
                    temp = a[lo];
                    a[lo] = a[mid];
                    a[mid] = temp;
                    lo++;
                    mid++;
                    break;
                }
                    // If the element is 1
                case 1:
                    mid++;
                    break;
                    // If the element is 2
                case 2: {
                    temp = a[mid];
                    a[mid] = a[hi];
                    a[hi] = temp;
                    hi--;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
